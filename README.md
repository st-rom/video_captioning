# Image-Captioning-Project

## Introduction
This repository contains my implementation of a video captioning system. This system takes as input a **video** and generates a **caption** describing the event in the video. 

## Requirements
For running our code and reproducing the results, the following packages need to be installed first. We have used Python 3.6 for the whole of this project.

PIP Packages:
* numpy
* argparse
* imutils
* time
* cv2
* os

Also you should download the pre-trained YOLO v3 weights file from this link and place it in the current directory or you can directly download to the current directory in terminal using

$ wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

## Running instructions

## Sample results

Attached below are a few screenshots from caption generation for videos from the **validation set**.
